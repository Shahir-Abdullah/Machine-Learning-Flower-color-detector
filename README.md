# The color detection of a flower  

It is my first ML mini project which demonstates the nural nodes of ML. It is built from scratch and without any help of third party libraries or frameworks. It is just built on JS and simple basic core ML mathematical formula so that any beginner can grasp the core science of ML and ML nural nodes. After some sort of training the model it can almost 90% accurately guess the color of a flower between two colors.

It's very easy to make some words **bold** and other words *italic* with Markdown. You can even [link to Google!](http://google.com)
