# The color detection of a flower  

It is my first ML mini project which demonstates the neural nodes of ML. It is built from scratch and without any help of third party libraries or frameworks. It is just built on JS and simple basic core ML mathematical formula so that any beginner can grasp the core science of ML and ML neural nodes. After some sort of training the model it can almost 90% accurately guess the color of a flower between two colors.
