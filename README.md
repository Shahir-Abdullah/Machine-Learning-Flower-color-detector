# The color detection of a flower  

It is my first ML mini project which demonstates the neural nodes of ML. It is built from scratch and without any help of third party libraries or frameworks. It is just built on JS and simple basic core ML mathematical formula so that any beginner can grasp the core science of ML and ML neural nodes. After some sort of training the model it can almost 90% accurately guess the color of a flower between two colors. 


### This is a simple demonstation of ML for the beginner by the Author @jonasbostoen

The core idea was taken from here. I made it's JS version and made the frontend html so that it could be easily demonstrated remotely. Also I deployed the project in Glitch. [Link of the project](https://silken-penalty.glitch.me)
The author's project is written in Python. You can check them out [here](https://github.com/jonasbostoen/simple-neural-network)
