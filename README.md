# The color detection of a flower  

It is my first ML mini project which demonstates the neural nodes of ML. It is built from scratch and without any help of third party libraries or frameworks. It is just built on JS and simple basic core ML mathematical formula so that any beginner can grasp the core science of ML and ML neural nodes. After some sort of training the model it can almost 90% accurately guess the color of a flower between two colors. First the flower is trained from some test data. The flower has either blue or red colored patels. And after a while it will generate a regression line which will help the model to predict the color of the flower. The is a question mark data in the graph you will see which is in the red area means the question mark is of flower color red. The curson of your pc will act as new data input of the color of patels. And the type of color will be shown on the top right corner of the graph if your curson hovers aroung the graph. Depending on the blue or red zone the curson is in the model will predict the color of the flower.

The core idea was taken from here. I made it's JS version and made the frontend html so that it could be easily demonstrated remotely. Also I deployed the project in Glitch. [Check the project](https://silken-penalty.glitch.me)
The author's project is written in Python. You can check them out [here](https://github.com/jonasbostoen/simple-neural-network)
